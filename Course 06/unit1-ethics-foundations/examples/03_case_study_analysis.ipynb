    "\n",
    "**BEFORE this notebook**: We knew ethical frameworks and decision-making processes but hadn't applied them to real cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**AFTER this notebook**: We can:\n",
    "- ✅ Analyze real-world AI ethics case studies (like COMPAS)\n",
    "- ✅ Identify ethical issues using multiple frameworks\n",
    "- ✅ Evaluate the severity of ethical problems\n",
    "- ✅ Apply ethical frameworks to real scenarios\n",
    "- ✅ Visualize ethical issues for better understanding\n",
    "- ✅ Extract lessons learned to prevent future problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways | الاستنتاجات الرئيسية\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Real-World Impact**: AI systems can have serious ethical issues that affect real people's lives\n",
    "2. **Multiple Perspectives**: Different ethical frameworks help identify different types of problems\n",
    "3. **Severity Matters**: Not all ethical issues are equal - some are more critical than others\n",
    "4. **Learning from Failures**: Case studies provide valuable lessons for future development\n",
    "5. **Systematic Analysis**: Following a structured approach ensures comprehensive ethical evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps | الخطوات التالية\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📓 **Unit 2**: Bias and Justice (deep dive into bias concepts introduced in this case!)\n",
    "- 📓 **Unit 3**: Privacy and Data Ethics (learn about data protection and privacy rights!)\n",
    "- 📓 **All Units**: Use case study analysis skills throughout the course!\n",
