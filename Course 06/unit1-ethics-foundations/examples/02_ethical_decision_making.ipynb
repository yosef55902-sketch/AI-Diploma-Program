    "**BEFORE starting this notebook**, you should have completed:\n",
    "- ✅ **Example 1: Ethical Frameworks** - You need to understand ethical frameworks first!\n",
    "- ✅ **Basic Python knowledge**: Classes, dictionaries, functions\n",
    "- ✅ **Understanding of ethical frameworks**: Utilitarianism, Deontology, Rights-Based, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you haven't completed these**, you might struggle with:\n",

    "**This is the SECOND example** - it shows you how to USE the frameworks from Example 1!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this example SECOND?**\n",
    "- **Before** you can make ethical decisions, you need to know the frameworks\n",
    "- **Before** you can analyze cases, you need a decision-making process\n",
    "- **Before** you can evaluate AI systems, you need a structured approach\n",

    "\n",
    "Imagine you're a chef cooking a complex dish. **Before** you start, you follow a recipe - gather ingredients, prepare them in order, combine them properly, taste and adjust. **After** following the recipe step-by-step, you create a delicious, consistent meal!\n",
    "\n",
    "Same with ethical decisions: **Before** making decisions, we follow a framework - identify the problem, gather information, apply ethical principles, evaluate options. **After** following the framework step-by-step, we make well-reasoned, consistent ethical decisions!\n",

    "- **Consistency**: Same process for all decisions\n",
    "- **Thoroughness**: Don't miss important considerations\n",
    "- **Transparency**: Can explain how decision was made\n",
