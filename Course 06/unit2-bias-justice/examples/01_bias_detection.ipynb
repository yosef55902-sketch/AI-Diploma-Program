    "- ✅ **Basic Python knowledge**: Functions, dictionaries, data manipulation\n",
    "- ✅ **Basic ML knowledge**: Classification, train/test split, confusion matrices\n",
    "- ✅ **Understanding of bias**: What is algorithmic bias? (from Unit 1 case studies)\n",

    "\n",
    "**This is the FIRST example in Unit 2** - it teaches you how to detect bias in AI systems!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this example FIRST?**\n",
    "- **Before** you can mitigate bias, you need to detect it\n",
    "- **Before** you can ensure fairness, you need to measure it\n",
    "- **Before** you can fix problems, you need to identify them\n",
    "\n",
    "**Builds on**: \n",
    "- 📓 Unit 1: Foundations (ethical frameworks, case studies like COMPAS showed us bias exists!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Leads to**: \n",
    "- 📓 Example 2: Bias Mitigation (once we detect bias, we learn to fix it!)\n",
    "- 📓 Example 3: Fair Representation (ensuring fair representation in data)\n",
    "- 📓 Example 4: Bias Case Studies (analyzing real bias cases)\n",
    "- 📓 Example 5: Fair AI Development (building fair AI systems)\n",

    "**Why this order?**\n",
    "1. Detection provides **measurement tools** (needed before mitigation)\n",

    "\n",
    "Imagine you're a doctor diagnosing a patient. **Before** you can treat an illness, you need to diagnose it - run tests, check symptoms, identify the problem. **After** diagnosis, you can prescribe the right treatment!\n",
    "\n",
    "Same with AI bias: **Before** we can fix bias, we need to detect it - measure fairness metrics, check for disparities, identify where bias exists. **After** detection, we can apply the right mitigation strategies!\n",

    "\n",
    "## Why Bias Detection Matters | لماذا يهم اكتشاف التحيز؟\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias detection is essential for ethical AI:\n",
    "- **Identify Problems**: Find where bias exists in your models\n",
    "- **Measure Fairness**: Quantify how fair (or unfair) your system is\n",
