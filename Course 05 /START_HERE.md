## ✅ Day 1 Checklist | قائمة اليوم الأول

Follow these steps in order. Don't skip any!  
اتبع هذه الخطوات بالترتيب. لا تتخطى أي خطوة!

### Step 1: Check Prerequisites | الخطوة 1: تحقق من المتطلبات الأساسية

**Before starting this course, you should have:**
- [ ] **Python 3.8 or higher** (Python 3.10 or 3.11 recommended)
- [ ] **Basic Python programming knowledge**: Variables, data types, functions, classes
- [ ] **Familiarity with NumPy and Pandas** (will be covered, but prior knowledge helps)

**If you're new to Python:**  
⚠️ Complete a Python basics course first! This course assumes you know Python fundamentals.

**If you don't have Python or have an old version:**  
Install Python 3.10 or 3.11 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

---

### Step 2: Check Python Version | الخطوة 2: تحقق من إصدار بايثون

Open your terminal/command prompt and type:

```bash
python --version
```

**You need:** Python 3.8 or higher (3.10 or 3.11 recommended)

**If you don't have Python or have an old version:**  
Install Python 3.10 or 3.11 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

---

### Step 3: Install Libraries | الخطوة 3: تثبيت المكتبات

**Follow the installation guide:** See `DOCS/` folder for detailed instructions.

**Quick method (if you're comfortable with terminal):**

```bash
# 1. Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv

# 2. Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# 4. Install all libraries
pip install -r ../requirements.txt

# 5. Verify installation
pip check
```

**If you see errors:** Read `DOCS/SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for troubleshooting.

---

### Step 4: Read the Course Overview | الخطوة 4: اقرأ نظرة عامة على الدورة

**Open and read:** `README.md`

This file explains:
- What this course covers
- The 5 course units
- The learning path
- How units connect to each other

**Don't skip this!** It's only 5-10 minutes to read and will save you hours of confusion later.

---

### Step 5: Start with Unit 1 | الخطوة 5: ابدأ بالوحدة الأولى

**Open:** `unit1-introduction/examples/01_data_science_intro.py` (or `.ipynb`)

**Why this unit FIRST?**
- All other units use pandas and NumPy extensively
- You need to learn these libraries BEFORE learning data cleaning/visualization
- This unit teaches you the tools you'll use in all other units

**Don't jump ahead!** Each unit builds on the previous one.

## 🆘 Need Help? | تحتاج مساعدة?

### Common Issues:

**Problem:** "No module named 'pandas'" or "No module named 'numpy'"  
**Solution:** You haven't installed libraries. Go back to Step 3.

**Problem:** "Python version too old"  
**Solution:** Install Python 3.10 or 3.11 from python.org

**Problem:** "I don't understand the notebook"  
**Solution:** 
1. Check if you have Python basics knowledge
2. Make sure you're doing units in order (1 → 2 → 3...)
3. Read the README.md in each unit folder

**Problem:** "Libraries conflict with each other"  
**Solution:** Use virtual environment (see Step 3)
