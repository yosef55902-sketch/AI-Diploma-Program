        "In this module, you've mastered the fundamental mathematical structures that power all machine learning:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Vectors and Matrices**: You learned that all data in ML is represented as vectors (single data points) and matrices (collections of data points). Each row represents a sample, and each column represents a feature. This structure enables efficient batch processing in ML algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Matrix Operations**: You discovered that matrix multiplication is the core operation in neural networks. The dot product (`@` operator) transforms data through layers, and understanding matrix dimensions is crucial for debugging ML code. Transpose operations help align data for different computations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Linear Transformations**: You saw how matrices can rotate, scale, and transform data. These transformations are fundamental to feature engineering, data preprocessing, and understanding how neural network layers transform input data.\n",
