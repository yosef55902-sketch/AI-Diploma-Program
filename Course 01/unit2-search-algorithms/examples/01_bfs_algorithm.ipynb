    "\n",
    "Great job completing this example!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm:**\n",
    "- **How it works**: Explores graph level-by-level, visiting all neighbors of current node before moving to next level\n",
    "- **Data structure**: Uses a queue (FIFO - First In First Out) to process nodes in order of discovery\n",
    "- **Guarantee**: Always finds the shortest path (in terms of number of edges) in unweighted graphs\n",
    "- **Memory**: Stores all nodes at current level, so memory usage can be high for wide graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Implementation Details:**\n",
    "- **Queue**: Uses `collections.deque` for efficient queue operations\n",
    "- **Visited tracking**: Uses a set to avoid revisiting nodes (prevents infinite loops)\n",
    "- **Path tracking**: Maintains the path from start to current node for each exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use BFS:**\n",
    "- ✅ Finding shortest path in unweighted graphs\n",
    "- ✅ Level-order traversal of trees\n",
    "- ✅ Finding all nodes at a specific distance\n",
    "- ⚠️ Not ideal for: Deep graphs (uses more memory), weighted graphs (use Dijkstra's instead)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔗 How This Connects:\n",
    "\n",
    "**This example builds on and leads to:**\n",
    "- **Unit 1: AI Foundations** - Search algorithms are fundamental AI problem-solving techniques\n",
    "- **Example 2: DFS Algorithm** - Compare BFS (level-by-level) with DFS (deep-first) to understand different search strategies\n",
    "- **Example 3: A* Algorithm** - Advanced search that combines BFS concepts with heuristics for intelligent search\n",
    "- **Unit 3: Knowledge Representation** - Search algorithms help navigate knowledge graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "**📚 Related Content:**\n",
    "- **Course 02, Notebook 1**: For a deeper, comprehensive explanation of BFS with more examples and theory, see `Course 02/NOTEBOOKS/01_Introduction_Search_Algorithms.ipynb`\n",
    "- **Why both exist**: This Course 01 example is a **simple introduction** for beginners. Course 02 provides **comprehensive coverage** with detailed explanations, visualizations, and connections to other AI concepts.\n",
    "- **📖 Course Navigation**: For a complete guide to navigating between courses and understanding duplications, see `COURSE_MAP.md` in the root directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why learn BFS first?**\n",
    "1. **Simplest search algorithm**: Easiest to understand and implement\n",
    "2. **Foundation**: Other search algorithms (DFS, A*) build on similar concepts\n",
    "3. **Practical**: Used in many real-world applications (GPS, game AI, web crawling)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Student Questions:**\n",
    "- **Q: Why use a queue (FIFO) for BFS?**\n",
    "  - Answer: Queue = First In First Out → explores nodes level by level\n",
    "  - BFS explores all neighbors at current level before going deeper\n",
    "  - Example: Level 0 (start), Level 1 (neighbors), Level 2 (neighbors of neighbors)\n",
    "  - Queue ensures we process nodes in order of discovery → finds shortest path\n",
    "- **Q: Why does BFS find the shortest path?**\n",
    "  - Answer: BFS explores level by level → first time we reach goal = shortest path\n",
    "  - If goal is at level 3, we explore all level 2 nodes first → guaranteed shortest\n",
    "  - DFS might go deep first → might find longer path before shorter one\n",
    "- **Q: When should I use BFS vs DFS?**\n",
    "  - Answer: BFS = shortest path, level-order, uses more memory\n",
    "  - DFS = any path, deep exploration, uses less memory\n",
    "  - Use BFS when: Need shortest path, graph is wide (not deep)\n",
    "  - Use DFS when: Need any path, graph is deep, memory is limited\n",
    "- **Q: Why does BFS use more memory than DFS?**\n",
    "  - Answer: BFS stores all nodes at current level in queue\n",
    "  - Wide graph = many nodes per level = large queue\n",
    "  - DFS stores only current path in stack = less memory\n",
    "  - Example: Tree with 1000 nodes at level 3 → BFS stores 1000, DFS stores ~3\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- Complete the exercises in `exercises/` folder to implement BFS yourself\n",
    "- Review the quiz materials in `quizzes/` folder\n",
    "- Proceed to **Example 2: DFS Algorithm** to learn a different search strategy\n",
    "- Then try **Example 3: A* Algorithm** for intelligent search\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 Tips for Success:**\n",
    "- **Install libraries**: `pip install matplotlib networkx` for graph visualizations\n",
    "- **Python version**: Use Python 3.8+ for compatibility\n",
    "- **Execute in order**: Run cells sequentially\n",
    "- **Experiment**: Try different start/goal nodes to see how BFS explores different paths\n"
