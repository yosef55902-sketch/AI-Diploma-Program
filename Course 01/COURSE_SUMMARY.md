WHAT IS INTELLIGENCE?
STRONG & WEAK AI

--- Page 10 ---

WHAT IS INTELLIGENCE?
”It is not my aim to surprise or shock you – but the simplest way I can
summarize is to say that there are now in the world machines that can
think, that learn, and that create.
Moreover, their ability to do these things is going to increase rapidly until
— in a visible future — the range of problems they can handle will be
coextensive with the range to which human mind has been applied.”
by Herbert A Simon (1957)
Jackson, P. C. (2019). Introduction to artificial intelligence. Courier Dover Publications.

--- Page 11 ---

STRONG AND WEAK AI
Weak AI — acting intelligently
The belief that machines can be made to act as if they are intelligent
Strong AI — being intelligent
The belief that those machines are actually thinking
Most AI researchers don’t care
“the question of whether machines can think...
...is about as relevant as whether submarines can swim.” 
(Edsger W Dijkstra, 1984)
Jackson, P. C. (2019). Introduction to artificial intelligence. Courier Dover Publications.

--- Page 12 ---

WEAK AI 
Weak AI is a category that is flexible
as soon as we understand how an AI-program works, it appears less
“intelligent”.
And as soon as AI is successful, it becomes an own research area!
e.g., search algorithms, natural language processing, optimization,
theorem proving, machine learning etc.
And AI is left with the remaining hard-to-solve problems!
Jackson, P. C. (2019). Introduction to artificial intelligence. Courier Dover Publications.

Jackson, P. C. (2019). Introduction to artificial intelligence. Courier Dover Publications.

--- Page 15 ---

Proposed by Alan Turing (1950) to operationally define intelligence.
A computer passes the test if a human interrogator cannot distinguish its responses from a human's.
Capabilities required to pass the standard Turing Test:
Natural Language Processing: For successful communication.
Knowledge Representation: To store and use information.
Automated Reasoning: To answer questions and draw conclusions.
Machine Learning: To adapt and detect patterns.
The test avoids physical interaction as simulating a person physically isn't essential for intelligence.
Total Turing Test:
Includes video signals for testing perceptual abilities and physical object interaction.
Additional requirements:
Computer Vision: To perceive objects.
Robotics: For object manipulation and movement.
ACTING HUMANLY
Jackson, P. C. (2019). Introduction to artificial intelligence. Courier Dover Publications.

--- Page 16 ---

The cognitive modeling approach o Trying to understand and model how the human mind works
 Cognitive Science focuses on modeling how people think.
We need to understand the actual workings of human minds. There are three ways to do this:
Introspection – trying to catch our own thoughts as they go by.
Psychological experiments – observing a person in action.
Brain imaging – observing the brain in action.
The interdisciplinary field of cognitive science brings together computer models from AI and experimental
techniques from psychology to construct precise and testable theories of the human mind.THINKING HUMANLY
Jackson, P. C. (2019). Introduction to artificial intelligence. Courier Dover Publications.

--- Page 17 ---

The "laws of thought" approach,
Trying to understand how we actually think, and model how we should think.
Use “symbolic logic” to capture and manipulated the laws of rational thought as symbols for the
derivation for thoughts.
Limitations?
Not all intelligent behavior is mediated by logical deliberation.
Not easy to take informal knowledge and state it in the formal terms required by logical notation,
particularly when the knowledge is less than 100% certain.THINKING RATIONALLY
Jackson, P. C. (2019). Introduction to artificial intelligence. Courier Dover Publications.

--- Page 18 ---

The "rational agent" approach,
To achieve one’s goals, given one’s beliefs or understanding about the world.
An agent is a system that perceives an environment and acts within that environment.
Abstractly, an agent is a function that maps percept histories to actions: 𝑓 : 𝒫  → 𝒜
An intelligent agent is one that acts rationally with respect to its goals.
For example, an agent that is designed to play a game should make moves that increase its chances
of winning the game!
A rational agent is one that acts rationally to achieve the best outcome, or the best-expected outcome
when there is uncertainty.
Achieving “perfect rationality”, i.e., making the best decision theoretically possible, is not usually possible
due to limited resources in a real environment (e.g., time, memory, computational power, uncertainty, etc.).
• The trick is to do the best with the available information and resources.ACTING RATIONALLY

THE OBJECTVIE OF AI
The ultimate goal of artificial intelligence is to reach human-
level intelligence on a wide range of tasks.
Solve complex problems that human cannot perform,
understand, or comprehend.

CLASSICAL AI VS MODERN AI
The goal of classical AI was to explicitly
represent human knowledge using facts
and rules.
Facts and rules had to be explicitly
specified by people which makes them
either limited or not well-defined!Classical AI (Before 1990s) Modern AI (Post-2000s):
Key Techniques include:
Expert systems, Rule-based systems,
Fuzzy systems, and Symbolic ReasoningModern AI has become more effective due
to advancements in data volume,
statistical models, and computing power. 
It can autonomously infer rules, patterns,
and irregularities from data.
Key Techniques include:
Machine learning, computational intelligence
(e.g., neural networks,).
Poole & Mackworth, 2010 (http://artint.info/slides/), and Russell & Norvig, 2005 (http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)

Agents & Rationality

--- Page 7 ---

An agent perceives its environment via sensors and acts upon it via actuators.
Examples of Agents:
Human Agent:
Sensors: Eyes, ears, other organs.
Actuators: Hands, legs, vocal tract.
Robotic Agent:
Sensors: Cameras, infrared range finders.
Actuators: Motors, other mechanical parts.
Key Design Elements: PAGE
Percepts: Inputs from the environment.
Actions: Outputs to affect the environment.
Goals: Objectives to achieve.
Environments: Contexts in which the agent operates.
What is an Agent? 
Jackson, P. C. (2019). Introduction to artificial intelligence. Courier Dover Publications.

--- Page 8 ---

Percepts: Location, contents (e.g., dirty/clean).
Actions: Left, Right, Clean, NoOp.
Agent Function:
If square is dirty → Clean.
Else → Move to another square.
Key Question:
What makes a good agent function? Who decides?
Agent Example: Vacuum-Cleaner Agent
Jackson, P. C. (2019). Introduction to artificial intelligence. Courier Dover Publications.

--- Page 9 ---

Performance Measure:
Points for squares cleaned per time.
Penalties for unnecessary moves.
Rational Agent:
Maximizes the performance measure based on
percept history and built-in knowledge.
Rational ≠ Successful:
Rational agents lack omniscience and cannot
predict all outcomes.Rationality & Performance
Jackson, P. C. (2019). Introduction to artificial intelligence. Courier Dover Publications.

--- Page 10 ---

PEAS (Task Environment Design):
Performance Measure: Success criteria.
Environment: External world.
Actuators: Action mechanisms.
Sensors: Perception mechanisms.PEAS Framework
Example: Autonomous Car:
Performance: Safety, fuel efficiency, time optimization.
Environment: Roads, traffic, pedestrians.
Actuators: Steering, brakes, signals.
Sensors: Cameras, GPS, sonar.

Environment Types
Dimensions of Complexity:
Observable: Full vs. Partial.
Deterministic: Deterministic vs. Stochastic.
Episodic: Episodic vs. Sequential.
Static: Static vs. Dynamic.
Discrete: Discrete vs. Continuous.
Agents: Single vs. Multiple.
Real World:
Partially Observable, Stochastic, Sequential, Dynamic,
Continuous, Multi-Agent.Environment Types
Jackson, P. C. (2019). Introduction to artificial intelligence. Courier Dover Publications.

--- Page 12 ---

Fully observable vs. partially observable:
Fully Observable Environment: The agent's sensors provide complete information about the environment's
state, allowing it to choose actions without uncertainty.
Partially Observable Environment: The agent lacks full information due to noisy or inaccurate sensors or
missing data, requiring it to make informed guesses about the environment.The Nature of Environments
Single-agent vs. multi-agent :
Single-Agent Environment: The agent operates independently without interactions with other agents.
Multi-Agent Environment: Multiple agents interact, which can be competitive (e.g., chess: one agent's gain is
another's loss) or cooperative (e.g., taxi-driving: avoiding collisions benefits all agents) or a mix of both.
Deterministic vs. stochastic:
Deterministic Environment: The next state is entirely determined by the current state and the agent's actions;
otherwise, it is stochastic (e.g., taxi driving with unpredictable events).
Uncertain Environment: Either not fully observable or not deterministic; stochastic environments involve
probabilistic outcomes, while non-deterministic ones lack defined probabilities for outcomes.
Jackson, P. C. (2019). Introduction to artificial intelligence. Courier Dover Publications.

--- Page 13 ---

Episodic vs. sequential :
Episodic Environment: Each decision is independent of past and future decisions, simplifying the agent's task
(e.g., spotting defective parts on an assembly line).
Sequential Environment: Current decisions affect future outcomes, requiring the agent to consider long-term
consequences (e.g., chess, taxi driving).The Nature of Environments
Static vs. dynamic:
Static Environment: Does not change while the agent is deliberating, simplifying decision-making as the agent
need not monitor changes (e.g., a solved puzzle).
Dynamic Environment: Continuously changes, requiring the agent to act quickly as inaction is treated as a
decision (e.g., real-time navigation). Semi-Dynamic: The environment stays static, but the agent's
performance score changes over time.
Discrete vs. continuous:
Static Environment: Remains unchanged during the agent's deliberation, simplifying decision-making as time and
environmental updates are not a concern.
Dynamic Environment: Changes while the agent deliberates, requiring quick decisions as inaction is treated as
doing nothing; Semi-Dynamic: The environment is static, but the agent's performance score changes over time.

Defining Solutions:
Solutions must handle unstated assumptions with common-
sense reasoning.
Types of Solutions:
Optimal: Best solution by quality measure.
Satisfying: Adequate solution.
Approx. Optimal: Close to the best possible.
Probable: Likely a valid solution.Solution Quality
Jackson, P. C. (2019). Introduction to artificial intelligence. Courier Dover Publications.

--- Page 16 ---

Simple Reflex Agent:
Acts based on current percept; ignores history.
Model-Based Reflex Agent:
Maintains internal state based on percept history.
Goal-Based Agent:
Actions aim to achieve defined goals.
Utility-Based Agent:
Measures performance through utility functions.
Learning Agent:
Adapts and improves through experience (online/offline).Types of Agents
Jackson, P. C. (2019). Introduction to artificial intelligence. Courier Dover Publications.

--- Page 17 ---

This type of agent is usually made of a general-purpose interpreter for condition-action rules to
create rule sets for specific task environments.
For example: the vacuum world agent is a simple reflex agent (because its decision is based
only on the current location and on whether that location contains dirt).
By ignoring the percept history, the agent program become very small compared to the corresponding
table (from 4T to 4 possibilities).
This type relies on condition-action rules (Also called situation- action rules, productions, or if-then
rules):
if car-in-front-is-braking then initiate-braking. 
Advantage:
Simple enough!  
Disadvantage:
Limited intelligence ~ Actions depend only on the current information provided by their sensors!
Works only if the environment is fully observable!
Can lead to Infinite loops.Simple reflex agents
Jackson, P. C. (2019). Introduction to artificial intelligence. Courier Dover Publications.

--- Page 18 ---

The most effective way to handle partial observability is to keep track of the part of the world that the
agent can’t see now.
The agent maintains an internal state (i.e., memory) that depends on the percept history.
Hence, has an access to information that is not currently available to their sensors.
The internal state can contain information about the state of the external environment.
This knowledge about “how the world works” is called a model of the world. An agent that uses such a
model is called a model-based agent.Model-based reflex agents
Jackson, P. C. (2019). Introduction to artificial intelligence. Courier Dover Publications.

--- Page 19 ---

Knowing something about the current state of the environment is not always enough to decide what
to do.
For example: at a road intersection, the taxi can turn left, turn right, or go straight on. The correct
decision depends on where the taxi is trying to go to.
The appropriate action for the agent will often depend on what its goals are, and so it must be provided
with some goal information.
If a long sequence of actions is required to reach the goal, then search and planning must be
implemented.
The goal-based agent is more flexible:
We can simply specify a new goal, rather than re-programming all the rules.Goal-based agents
Jackson, P. C. (2019). Introduction to artificial intelligence. Courier Dover Publications.

--- Page 20 ---

Goals alone are not enough to generate high-quality behavior in most environments.
This is because there are often many sequences of actions that can result in the same goal being
achieved.
For example: many action sequences will get the taxi to its destination (thereby achieving the goal)
but some are quicker, safer, more reliable, or cheaper than others.
This type of agent programs appear when we design decision making agents that must handle the
uncertainty inherent in stochastic or partially observable environments.
This type of agent makes its decisions based on the maximum utility of its choices. Its focus is not
only on achieving goals but to find the best alternative/way to reach that particular goal.
To do so, we utilize a utility function of choice, which maps a state or sequence of states to a value, to
rate each possible solution against the general performance measure.
A rational utility-based agent always chooses the action that maximizes the expected utility of the action
outcomes.Utility-based agents
Jackson, P. C. (2019). Introduction to artificial intelligence. Courier Dover Publications.

--- Page 21 ---

his type of agent operates in initially unknown environments and become more knowledgeable over time
so as to improve performance.
Consists of four main components:
Critic: Evaluates how well the agent is doing wrt the external performance standard.
Learning element:: Makes improvements
Performance element: Contains the knowledge about the environment and selects the actions.
Problem generator: Suggests actions that will lead to new and informative experiences.
For example, from Google Assistant to other predictive searches, all use learning agents to adapt and
learn about the user and make accurate suggestions, and recommendations, and deliver appropriate
ads.Learning agents

Agent Logic & Types
Jackson, P. C. (2019). Introduction to artificial intelligence. Courier Dover Publications.

--- Page 23 ---

Each state of the world is indivisible (it has no internal
structure).
For example: the problem of finding a driving
route from one end of a country to the other via
some sequence of cities.
For the purposes of solving this problem, it may suffice to
reduce the state of world to just the name of the city we
are in— a single atom of knowledge.
The algorithms underlying search and game-playing (see
later this semester) all work mostly with atomic
representations.Agent Representations
Atomic representation
Jackson, P. C. (2019). Introduction to artificial intelligence. Courier Dover Publications.

--- Page 24 ---

A factored representation splits up each state into a
fixed set of variables or attributes, each of which can
have a value.
Two different factored states can share some
attributes such as being at some particular GPS
location (see back circles in right figure).Agent Representations

PHILOSOPHY OF AI 
IS AI POSSIBLE?
Poole & Mackworth, 2010 (http://artint.info/slides/), and Russell & Norvig, 2005 (http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)

--- Page 26 ---

There are different opinions...
...some are slightly positive:
“every feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a
machine can be made to simulate it” (McCarthy et al, 1955) ...
and some lean towards the negative:
“AI stands not even a ghost of a chance of producing durable results”
(Sayre, 1993)
It’s all in the definitions:
what do we mean by “thinking” and “intelligence”?Is AI Possible ? 
Poole & Mackworth, 2010 (http://artint.info/slides/), and Russell & Norvig, 2005 (http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)

Paper: "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" – Alan Turing (1950).
Key Contributions:
Introduced the "imitation game" (Turing Test) to define intelligence.
Discussed objections to AI, including nearly all objections raised since.

TURING’s Key Objections
The Theological
Objection:
Claim: Thinking
requires an
immortal soul,
which only
humans have.01
The "Heads in
the Sand"
Objection:
Claim: The idea
of machines
thinking is too
dreadful; we hope
it’s not true.02
The Mathematical
Objection:
Claim: Based on
Gödel’s
incompleteness
theorem, there are
limits to what machines
can do logically.03
The Argument from
Consciousness:
Claim: Machines
cannot feel
emotions like
pleasure, grief, or
anger.04
Arguments from Various
Disabilities:
Claim: Machines will never do
certain human things like:
Be kind, resourceful,
beautiful, friendly.
Have a sense of humor or
tell right from wrong.
Fall in love or enjoy
strawberries and cream.05
Lady Lovelace’s
Objection:
Claim: Machines
cannot originate
anything; they
only do what we
program them to
do.06
Argument from
Continuity in the
Nervous System:
Claim: The nervous
system’s continuous
behavior cannot be
mimicked by
discrete-state
machines.07
Argument from
Informality of
Behavior:
Claim: Human
behavior lacks strict
rules; machines with
fixed rules cannot
replicate this.08
The Argument from Extrasensory Perception (ESP):
Scenario: A man with telepathic abilities guesses the
suit of cards more accurately than a machine.
Claim: Machines cannot replicate such abilities.
Turing’s Comment: This was the strongest argument
in his view, given the statistical evidence for ESP at
the time.09

Will AI lead to superintelligence?
“...ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the
appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human
affairs, as we know them, could not continue” (von Neumann, mid-1950s)
“We will successfully reverse-engineer the human brain by the mid-2020s. By the end of that decade,
computers will be capable of human-level intelligence.” (Kurzweil, 2011)
“There is not the slightest reason to believe in a coming singularity.” (Pinker, 2008)THE TECHNOLOGICAL SINGULARITY

--- Page 34 ---

CLASSICAL SEARCH
ALGORITHMS

--- Page 35 ---

Often we are not given an algorithm to solve a problem, but only a specification of a solution
— we have to search for it.
A typical problem is when the agent is in one state, it has a set of deterministic actions it can
carry out, and wants to get to a goal state.
Many AI problems can be abstracted into the problem of finding a path in a directed graph.
Often there is more than one way to represent a problem as a graph.
State-Space Search:
The agent explores possible states and actions to find a solution.
The goal is to find a path from the start state to the goal state.WHAT IS SEARCH IN AI?
Poole & Mackworth, 2010 (http://artint.info/slides/), and Russell & Norvig, 2005 (http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)

--- Page 36 ---

Problems are often represented as graphs.
For example, consider cities as nodes and roads connecting them as edges. A path
represents a series of roads leading from one city to another.
Nodes (States): Represent the points or conditions in the problem.
Edges (Actions): Transitions or steps that connect nodes.
Path: A sequence of edges leading from the start node to the goal node. Problems are often

Uninformed Search:
These algorithms do not use additional information about the goal.
Depth-First Search (DFS):
Imagine exploring a maze by always turning left until you hit a dead end, then
backtracking to try a new path. This is how DFS operates. Explores one path
deeply before backtracking.
Breadth-First Search (BFS): 
Explores all nodes at a given depth before going deeper.
Uniform-Cost Search (UCS): 
Explores paths with the lowest cost first.TYPES OF SEARCH ALGORITHMS:
Poole & Mackworth, 2010 (http://artint.info/slides/), and Russell & Norvig, 2005 (http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)

--- Page 43 ---

Heuristic Search:
These algorithms use a heuristic (a guiding function) to estimate the closeness to the goal.
What is a Heuristic?
A heuristic is a function that estimates how close a node is to the goal.
Examples of Heuristics:
Straight-Line Distance (SLD): The shortest distance between two points in navigation.
Manhattan Distance: Used in grid-based problems, sums the horizontal and vertical steps to
the goal.
Misplaced Tiles: For the 8-puzzle, counts how many tiles are not in their goal positions.
Greedy Best-First Search: 
Chooses the node that appears closest to the goal.
A*Search:
Combines UCS and heuristic information for optimal pathfinding.TYPES OF SEARCH ALGORITHMS:
Poole & Mackworth, 2010 (http://artint.info/slides/), and Russell & Norvig, 2005 (http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)

--- Page 44 ---

A generic search algorithm:
Given a graph, start nodes, and a goal description, incrementally explore paths
from the start nodes.
Maintain a frontier of nodes that are to be explored.
As search proceeds, the frontier expands into the unexplored nodes
until a goal node is encountered.
The way in which the frontier is expanded defines the search strategy.
Tree Search vs. Graph Search:
Tree Search: Does not check if a node has been visited, which might lead to
revisiting states.
Graph Search: Keeps track of visited nodes to avoid duplicating work and loops.HOW DO WE SEARCH IN A GRAPH?

Search as the Foundation of AI:
Search is a fundamental concept in AI because it models decision-making and problem-solving.
Many real-world problems—from navigation systems to robotics—r ely on search algorithms to find
efficient solutions.
These methods serve as a bridge to more complex AI tasks such as learning, optimization, and
planning.
Applications of Search:
Robotics: Planning paths for autonomous robots.
Gaming: Designing AI opponents that plan moves intelligently.
Optimization: Finding optimal resource allocations in logistics.
Why Search Matters:
Search algorithms are the starting point for understanding broader AI techniques. By mastering them,
you build a strong foundation for more advanced topics like machine learning and neural networks.CONCLUSION

Adversarial
Search

--- Page 2 ---

single agent controlling the environment
The agent looks to find a sequence of actions that leads to the goal | Goal-based search agent.
But what happens when other agents' interest conflict with you?
Game Playing | agent tries to anticipate the unpredictable opponent’s next move
Game-playing agents in AI are designed to be rational  and will choose the move that leads to the best or high-quality gain for them.
Adversarial search is a special type of search where multiple agents influence
the current problem state >> Competitive multi-agent environments.ADVERSARIAL SEARCH
Poole & Mackworth, 2010 (http://artint.info/slides/), and Russell & Norvig, 2005 (http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)

--- Page 3 ---

The solution in AI-based games is not a fixed sequence of actions but a strategy
(policy). 
We specify a move for every possible opponent reply.
Game playing in AI assumes competitive (unpredictable) multi-agent environments.ADVERSARIAL SEARCH
Poole & Mackworth, 2010 (http://artint.info/slides/), and Russell & Norvig, 2005 (http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)

--- Page 4 ---

Assumptions:
Environment is deterministic and fully observable (i.e., perfect information)
Competitive (unpredictable) multi-agent environments.
Two agents act alternately (taking turns).
Zero-sum game: One player in the game tries to maximize a single value, while the
other player tries to minimize it.
Game problem formulation:
The initial state.
Operators/Actions: legal moves a player can make.
Transition model: defines the result of a legal move.
Goal (terminal test): determines when the game is over.
Utility (payoff) function: measures the outcome of the game and its desirability.ADVERSARIAL SEARCH

--- Page 6 ---

HOW ADVERSARIAL SEARCH WORKS?
Game Tree Representation:  The diagram represents all possible states of the game as a
tree. The root is the current state of the game, and the branches are the potential moves
available to each player.
Utility Values:  At the termina l nodes (leaves), utility values represent the outcome of the
game:
+1 if Max wins.
-1 if Min wins.
0 for a draw.
Backward Induction:  The Minimax algorithm  is applied to evaluate the best move:
Starting from the terminal nodes, the utility values propagate back up the tree.1.
Max selects the move with the highest value from the child nodes.2.
Min selects the move with the lowest value from the child nodes.3.
This alternation continues until the best move for Max is identified at the root.4.
Poole & Mackworth, 2010 (http://artint.info/slides/), and Russell & Norvig, 2005 (http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)

--- Page 7 ---

MINIMAX ALGORITHM
Generate the Game Tree: Create a tree of all possible moves and outcomes from the current game state. 1.
Evaluate Terminal Nodes: Assign utility values to terminal nodes (end states). 2.
Backpropagate Utilities: 3.
If it’s Max’s turn, choose the child node with the maximum utility value.
If it’s Min’s turn, choose the child node with the minimum utility value.
Optimal Move Selection: At the root node (current game state), Max selects the move that leads to the best utility value for him
considering Min will respond optimally.4.
Poole & Mackworth, 2010 (http://artint.info/slides/), and Russell & Norvig, 2005 (http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)

--- Page 8 ---

WHY IS IT ADVERSARIAL?
The search is adversarial because the two players have directly opposing objectives:
Max wants to maximize the utility for himself.
Min wants to minimize Max's utility, effectively working against Max’s strategy.
This setup mirrors many competitive scenarios (e.g., chess, checkers, tic-tac-toe), where
each player's decision depe nds not only on their strategy but also on predicting the
opponent's moves.
Adversarial search is central to AI in games, allowing algorithms to simulate and counteract
an opponent's moves effectively.
Poole & Mackworth, 2010 (http://artint.info/slides/), and Russell & Norvig, 2005 (http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)

--- Page 9 ---

Complete?  Yes (if tree is finite)
Optimal?  Yes
Time Complexity:                      (m is max depth of the tree).
Space Complexity:
O(bm) when generates all actions at once
O(m) when generates actions one at a time.
The time complexity is a major problem in Minimax because it grows exponentially in the depth of the
tree, effectively with real games.
Possible remedy:  compu te the correct minimax decision without looking at every node in the game tree
à Pruning!
We shall consider a modification of Minimax technique called “ Alpha-Beta Pruning”
EVALUATING MINIMAX SEARCH:
Poole & Mackworth, 2010 (http://artint.info/slides/), and Russell & Norvig, 2005 (http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)

--- Page 10 ---

A technique applied to the standard Minimax tree and it returns the same move as minimax  but
prunes away branches that cannot possibly influence the final decision.
Alpha-beta pruning  can be applied to trees of any depth, and it is often possible to prune entire
subtrees rather than just leaves.
Main elements: Each node in the tree include two values, 𝜶  and 𝜷 .
𝜶 = the value of the best choice (i.e., highest-value) we have found so far at any choice point
along the path for MAX.
𝜷 = the value of the best choice (i.e., lowest-value) we have found so far at any choice point along the
path for MIN.
Basic Principle:  If a move is determined worse than another move already examined, then there is no
need for further examination of the node, i.e., when 𝜶  ≥ 𝜷 .ALPHA-BETA PRUNING

Knowledge-
based Agent

--- Page 2 ---

Knowledge  is information about a domain of interest that can be used  to solve
problems in that domain..
Solving a problem requires enough knowledge about it.
Framework of effective knowledge utilization:
1. Representing Knowledge (Knowledge Representation)
Creating a formal representation or encoding of the world.:
To make information computer-tractable (easy for a computer to process).
2. Using Knowledge (Reasoning, Inferencing, Planning)
Using the encoded knowledge to draw conclusions or make decisions.
Apply logical rules or algorithms.
Derive new facts or solve problems.
3. Obtaining New Knowledge (Learning)
Adding new information to the existing knowledge base.
Allows the system to adapt and improve over time.THE THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE

FIRST-ORDER LOGIC (FOL)
Why FOL?
FOL introduces objects, properties, and relations for complex reasoning.
Key Features of FOL:
Objects: Entities (e.g., people, numbers, cars).
Relations: Describe interactions (e.g., IsRed(x), ParentOf(x, y)).
Functions: Map objects to other objects (e.g., FatherOf(x)).

FIRST-ORDER LOGIC (FOL) 
SYNTAX OF FOL
Basic Components:
Constants: Specific objects (e.g., John, PSAU). a.
Variables: General placeholders (e.g., x, y). b.
Functions: Map objects to other objects (e.g., FatherOf(John)). c.
Predicates: Return True/False for relations (e.g., Greater(x, y)). d.
Logical Connectives: ∧ , ∨ , ¬, →, ↔. e.
Quantifiers: f.
Universal ( ∀ ): "For all" (e.g., ∀ x Smart(x)).
Existential ( ∃ ): "There exists" (e.g., ∃ x Knows(x, Math)).
FOL Translation
Translating natural language to FOL:
"Everybody loves Ali" → ∀ x Loves(x, Ali).
"Someone at Tuwaiq is smart" → ∃ x (At(x, Tuwaiq) ∧  Smart(x)).

--- Page 14 ---

FIRST-ORDER LOGIC (FOL) 
FOL INFERENCE METHODS
Universal Instantiation (UI):
Substitutes universally quantified variables with specific constants.
Example: ∀ x Parent(x)→Caring(x). Substitute {x = Sara}, yielding Parent(Sarah) → Caring(Sarah)
Existential Instantiation (EI):
Replaces existential variables with a new constant.
Example: ∃ x Crown(x) → Crown(C1), where C1 is a new constant.
Propositionalization:
Converts FOL into propositional logic by grounding sentences.
Unification:
Finds substitutions to make two predicates identical.
Example: UNIFY(Knows(John, x), Knows(John, Jane)) → {x/Jane}.
Forward and Backward Chaining:
Forward Chaining: Start with data, derive conclusions.
Backward Chaining: Start with a goal, trace back to data.

Semester One | Course OneIntroduction to Artificial Intelligence and Applications 
Unit 2 : AI Concepts,
Terminology and
Application Domains

--- Page 2 ---

Recap From Unit 1
In the early days of AI, the top-down approach to creating intelligent systems. The idea was to extract the
knowledge from people into some machine-readable form, and then use it to automatically solve problems.
This approach was based on two big ideas:
It is important to differentiate knowledge from information or data.
✅
✅ Knowledge is something which is contained in our head and represents our understanding of the world. 
 It is obtained by an active learning process, which integrates pieces of information that we receive into
our active model of the world.Knowledge
RepresentationReasoning

--- Page 3 ---

Recap From Unit 1
It is important to differentiate knowledge from information or data.
Data is something represented in physical media, such as written
text or spoken words. Data exists independently of human beings
and can be passed between people.
Information is how we interpret data in our head. For example,
when we hear the word computer, we have some understanding
of what it is.
Knowledge is information being integrated into our world model.
For example, once we learn what a computer is, we start having
some ideas about how it works, how much it costs, and what it
can be used for. This network of interrelated concepts forms our
knowledge.
Wisdom is yet one more level of our understanding of the world,
and it represents meta-knowledge, eg. some notion on how and
when the knowledge should be used.Image from Wikipedia, By Longlivetheux - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0

Expert Systems

--- Page 5 ---

Expert Systems
One of the early successes of AI were so-called expert systems 
Computer systems that were designed to act as an expert in some limited problem domain. 
They were based on a knowledge base extracted from one or more human experts, and they
contained an inference engine that performed some reasoning on top of it.
https://github.com/microsoft/AI-For-Beginners/tree/main

--- Page 6 ---

Expert Systems
Expert systems are built like the human reasoning system, which contains short-term memory and long-term
memory. Similarly, in knowledge-based systems we distinguish the following components:
Problem Memory:
Stores the current information about the problem being solved.
Example: A patient's temperature, blood pressure, or whether they have inflammation.
Known as static knowledge because it represents what we know right now—a snapshot of the problem.
Knowledge Base:
Holds long-term, general knowledge about the problem domain.
This knowledge is gathered from experts and remains the same for all consultations.
Called dynamic knowledge because it helps transition from one state of the problem to another.
Inference Engine:
Manages the entire problem-solving process.
Tasks:
Searches through the current problem state.
Asks questions to gather missing information.
Identifies and applies the correct rules to move forward.

--- Page 7 ---

Expert Systems
As an example, let's consider the following expert system of determining an animal based on its physical
characteristics:
Image by Dmitry Soshnikov. This diagram is called an
AND-OR tree, and it is a
graphical representation of a
set of production rules
Drawing a tree is useful at the
beginning of extracting
knowledge from the expert.
To represent the knowledge
inside the computer it is
more
rules.convenient to use

--- Page 8 ---

Expert Systems
You can notice that each condition on the of the
rule and the action are essentially object-
attribute-value (OAV) triplets. 
IF the animal eats meat
OR (animal has sharp teeth
 
 
eyes ) THEN the animal is a
carnivoreAND animal has claws
AND animal has forward-lookingWorking memory contains the set of OAV triplets
that correspond to the problem currently being
solved. A rules engine looks for rules for which a
condition is satisfied and applies them, adding
another triplet to the working memory.

--- Page 9 ---

Expert Systems
IF the animal eats meat
OR (animal has sharp teeth
 
 
eyes ) THEN the animal is a
carnivoreAND animal has claws
AND animal has forward-lookingConditions:
1.Animal - Eats - Meat
2.(If the animal eats meat)
3.Animal - Has Teeth - Sharp
4.(If the animal has sharp teeth)
5.Animal - Has Claws - True
6.(If the animal has claws)
7.Animal - Has Eyes - Forward-Looking
8.(If the animal has forward-looking eyes)
Action:
1.Animal - Is - Carnivore
2.(Then the animal is a carnivore)
These triplets form the basis for reasoning in the working memory, where conditions are evaluated,
and new knowledge (e.g., "Animal - Is - Carnivore") is added when rules are satisfied.

--- Page 10 ---

Forward vs. Backward Inference
Forward Inference (Data-Driven Reasoning)
Starts with what we already know (initial data in working
memory).
Works step by step to add new knowledge until we reach
the answer.
Steps:
1.Check if the goal is already known: If yes, stop and return
the result.
2.Find rules to apply: Look for rules whose conditions match
the current data (this creates a "conflict set").
3.Choose a rule to apply (Conflict Resolution):
Pick the first matching rule.
Choose randomly.
Pick the rule with the most specific conditions.
4.Apply the rule: Use the rule to add new knowledge to the
working memory.
5.Repeat: Go back to step 1 until the goal is reached.
Example: Diagnosing a patient based on existing lab results.Backward Inference (Goal-Driven Reasoning)
Starts with a specific goal (e.g., "What is the
diagnosis?").
Asks targeted questions to find the information needed
to reach the goal.
Steps:
1.Identify rules for the goal: Find rules that have the
desired answer on the Right-Hand Side (RHS).
2.If no rules exist, ask for missing data: If no rules cover
the goal, ask the user for the information.
3.Test one rule as a hypothesis: Try to prove the rule by
checking its conditions (Left-Hand Side, LHS).
4.Repeat for sub-goals: If the rule's conditions depend on
other unknowns, repeat the process for those sub-goals.
5.If a rule fails: Try another rule from step 3.
Example: In medical diagnosis, asking for specific tests
or symptoms only when needed to narrow down the
cause.

--- Page 11 ---

Implementing Expert Systems
Expert systems can be implemented using different tools:
Programming them directly in some high level programming language. This is not the best idea, because the main advantage
of a knowledge-based system is that knowledge is separated from inference, and potentially a problem domain expert should
be able to write rules without understanding the details of the inference process
Using expert systems shell, i.e. a system specifically designed to be populated by knowledge using some knowledge
representation language.
Let us implement some code

--- Page 12 ---

Ontologies and the Semantic Web
Background:
By the end of the 20th century, there was a push to improve how we find information on the Internet.
The idea: 
Use knowledge representation to annotate web resources so users can make very specific queries.
This idea became known as the Semantic Web.
Smart Knowledge Representation
A way to describe knowledge using Description Logics (DL), which provide a formal, structured, and
logical framework for understanding data.
Helps in organizing information into hierarchies and assigning properties to objects (like categories and
subcategories).
Beyond organizing, DL allows systems to reason or infer new facts automatically.
Ontology about transportation:
"All cars are vehicles."
"Toyota Camry is a car."
The system infers: "Toyota Camry is a vehicle."

--- Page 13 ---

Ontologies and the Semantic Web
Is it usable today?
Yes. Modern AI and search engines use similar techniques to infer relationships and provide better
recommendations or search results. 
Google uses ontologies to link related search terms (e.g., searching "Canine" may show results for "Dog").
Distributed Knowledge
Knowledge is distributed across multiple systems or websites, but concepts are uniquely identified using global
URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).
A "Dog" ontology in one database and a "Veterinary Care" ontology in another can link information seamlessly.
Makes data interoperable (easily shared and understood across systems).
Enables linking knowledge from diverse domains—biology, transportation, healthcare, etc.—on the global web.

--- Page 14 ---

Ontologies and the Semantic Web
Special XML-Based Languages
Tools to describe, structure, and share knowledge in a machine-readable format:
RDF (Resource Description Framework): A standard way to represent information about resources.
Example: Describe "Paris" with RDF:
"Paris is a city. It is in France."
RDFS (RDF Schema): Adds hierarchies and relationships.
Example: Define "City" as a subclass of "Location."
OWL (Ontology Web Language): More expressive, allowing for rules and reasoning.
Example: Define "City" and infer, "If Paris is a city, it is also a location."
Is it usable today?
Yes. These languages are actively used in:
Knowledge Graphs: Google, Microsoft, and Amazon build these to link data intelligently.
AI and Research: Fields like healthcare use OWL to create ontologies for diseases and treatments.

--- Page 15 ---

Core Concept: Ontology
What is an Ontology?
A formal specification of a domain (a specific topic or area).
Organizes knowledge as:
A hierarchy of objects (simple version).
Rules and relationships for inference (advanced version).
Purpose of Ontologies in the Semantic Web:
Help machines understand the meaning of data.
Example: In an ontology about animals:
Define "Dog" as a type of "Mammal."
Add rules: "Mammals have hair" → Automatically know "Dogs have hair."
Why is This Important?
Enables the web to move beyond simple keyword searches to understanding user queries.
Makes the web smarter, linking knowledge across sites.
Supports applications like intelligent search engines, AI assistants, and data integration tools.

--- Page 16 ---

Core Concept: Ontology
Real-World Applications of Ontologies in Food and Nutrition:
Health Apps:
An ontology can link food items to their nutritional content.
Query: "Which foods are rich in Vitamin C?"
The system uses the ontology to find and suggest items like oranges, apples, and strawberries.
E-commerce:
When you search for "Fruits" on a grocery website, it can automatically group apples, bananas, and other
fruits without needing manual categorization.

Real-world environments (sensors, user inputs, big data) introduce noise or errors.
Exam ple: A self-driving car’s sensors can be obstructed by weather, leading to
uncertain measurements.

AI’s Shift from Rules to Data

--- Page 10 ---

AI’s Shift from Rules to Data
Real-world AI often encounters imperfect or incomplete information
Foundations for Modern AI:
Almost all modern AI applications (computer vision, NLP, recommender systems, etc.)
rely on machine learning to make predictions or decisions under uncertainty.
Machine Learning is the dominant approach—algorithms learn patterns from data
rather than relying solely on hand-coded rules.

--- Page 11 ---

AI’s Shift from Rules to Data
Uncertainty as a Core Challenge:
Almost all modern AI fields—like computer vision, natural language processing, and
recommender systems—must deal with uncertain or ambiguous inputs.
Examples of AI Under Uncertainty:
Computer Vision: A system classifying images in low light or occluded scenes must
account for noise and partial views.
Natural Language Processing: Speech recognition deals with background noise and
variations in accents.
Recommender Systems: Predictions rely on partial user data, uncertain user
preferences, and shifting trends.

--- Page 12 ---

From Data to Decisions

--- Page 13 ---

From Data to Decisions
Machine learning uses statistical methods
(including Bayesian techniques) to cope with
incomplete or imperfect data.
Probabilistic models (e.g., Naive Bayes,
Hidden Markov Models, Bayesian Networks)
are used for classification, time-series
prediction, and more. Example on Konwledge representation using Bayesian networks

--- Page 14 ---

Why Probabilistic Models?
Inherent Uncertainty: Sensors, user inputs,
or natural phenomena (like weather) can
produce ambiguous data.
Adaptive Learning: Probabilistic models can
update their estimates whenever new
evidence appears, making them more robust
to fluctuations in data quality.
Decision-Making Under Risk: These
methods compute the probability of various
outcomes and let a system select the action
that maximizes some measure of success,
despite uncertainty.Example on Konwledge representation using Bayesian networks

--- Page 15 ---

Why This Matters?
Robustness: Even with noisy, incomplete, or evolving data (like constantly changing
spam strategies), the Naive Bayes approach remains effective by accumulating
evidence across many features.
Scalability: Probabilistic methods can be extended or combined with other
techniques (e.g., advanced NLP tools) as data grows.
Continuous Learning: Because these methods are rooted in probability, they offer
a natural mechanism for updating beliefs when the environment or data distribution
shifts.

--- Page 16 ---

AI Uncertainty

--- Page 17 ---

Uncertainty
Suppose A and B are two statements, If we implement if-then rule to these
statements, we might write A→B, Which means if A is true Then B is true, or if A is
false then B is false.
But consider a situation where we are not sure about whether A is true or false >>
So we cannot express this statement, this situation is called uncertainty.
So to represent uncertain knowledge, where we are not sure about the predicates,
>>> we need uncertain reasoning or probabilistic reasoning.

--- Page 18 ---

Causes of uncertainty
1. Information occurred from unreliable sources.
2. Experimental Errors
3. Equipment fault
4. Temperature variation
5. Climate change.

Probabilistic
Reasoning

--- Page 21 ---

Probabilistic Reasoning
Probabilistic reasoning is a way of knowledge representation where we apply the
concept of probability to indicate the uncertainty in knowledge. 
In probabilistic reasoning, we combine probability theory with logic to handle the
uncertainty.
 Need of probabilistic reasoning in AI
When there are unpredictable outcomes.
When specifications or possibilities of predicates becomes too large to handle.
When an unknown error occurs during an experiment.

--- Page 22 ---

Probabilistic Reasoning
In probabilistic reasoning, there are two ways to solve problems with uncertain
knowledge:

--- Page 37 ---

Probability
Probability can be defined as a chance that an uncertain event will occur. It is the
numerical measure of the likelihood that an event will occur.
The value of probability always remains between 0 and 1 that represent ideal
uncertainties.
1. 0 ≤ P(A) ≤ 1, where P(A) is the probability of an event A.
2. P(A) = 0, indicates total uncertainty in an event A.
3. P(A) =1, indicates total certainty in an event A.

--- Page 38 ---

P(¬A) = probability of a not happening event.
P(¬A) + P(A) = 1.We can find the probability of an uncertain event by using the below formula.Probability

--- Page 39 ---

Probabilistic Reasoning
Event: Each possible outcome of a variable is called an event. Sample space: The
collection of all possible events is called sample space. Random variables: Random
variables are used to represent the events and objects in the real world. Prior
probability: The prior probability of an event is probability computed before observing
new information. Posterior Probability: The probability that is calculated after all
evidence or information has taken into account. It is a combination of prior probability
and new information.

--- Page 40 ---

Conditional probability
Conditional probability is a probability of occurring an event when another event
has already happened.
Let's suppose, we want to calculate the event A when event B has already occurred,
Then, “the probability of A under the conditions of B", it can be written as:
P(A|B) = 
⋀Where P(AB)= Joint probability of A and B
P(B)= Marginal probability of B.P(A⋀B)

Bayes' theorem
Bayes' Theorem is a mathematical rule that helps us figure out the probability of
something happening based on new information, given what we already know.
Is it going to rain today, I can see clouds in the sky.
You know how often it rains on any given day in your city. Let’s say it rains 20% of the time P(A)
Incorporate new evidence:You look up and see clouds. You know that when it rains, it’s cloudy 90% of the time P(B∣ A).
But you also know that it’s cloudy even when it doesn’t rain, say 50% of the time
P(B∣ notA)).
Combine the two: Bayes' Theorem combines this information to update the probability of rain
today, taking the clouds into account.

--- Page 47 ---

Bayes' theorem
Let’s break it down:P(A∣ B): The probability of event AA happening, given that event BB has already
happened. This is what we are trying to find.
P(B∣ A): The probability of event BB happening if AA is true.
P(A): The overall probability of AA happening (before considering BB).
P(B): The overall probability of BB happening.Bayes' Theorem is a mathematical rule that helps us figure out the probability of
something happening based on new information, given what we already know.
Here’s the formula:

--- Page 48 ---

Bayes' theorem can be derived using product rule and conditional probability of
event A with known event B:
As from product rule we can write:
P(A ⋀ B)= P(A|B) P(B)
or
Similarly, the probability of event B with known event A:
P(A ⋀ B)= P(B|A) P(A)
Equating right hand side of both the equations, we will get:Bayes' theorem

--- Page 49 ---

It shows the simple relationship between joint and conditional probabilities. Here,
P(A|B) is known as posterior, which we need to calculate, and it will be read as Probability of
hypothesis A when we have occurred an evidence B.
P(B|A) is called the likelihood, in which we consider that hypothesis is true, then we calculate the
probability of evidence.
P(A) is called the prior probability, probability of hypothesis before considering the evidence
P(B) is called marginal probability, pure probability of an evidence.
In the equation (a), in general, we can write P (B) = P(A)*P(B|Ai)Bayes' theorem
Where A1, A2, A3,........, An is a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events

Application of Bayes' theorem in
Artificial intelligence

--- Page 51 ---

Following are some applications of Bayes' theorem:
It is used to calculate the next step of the robot when the already executed step is given.
Bayes' theorem is helpful in weather forecasting.
Bayesian belief network is key computer technology for dealing with probabilistic events and to solve a
problem which has uncertainty. We can define a Bayesian network as:
It is also called a Bayes network, belief network, decision network, or Bayesian model.
Bayesian networks are probabilistic, because these networks are built from a probability distribution,
and also use probability theory for prediction and anomaly detection.
It can also be used in various tasks including prediction, anomaly detection, diagnostics, automated
insight, reasoning, time series prediction, and decision making under uncertainty."A Bayesian network is a probabilistic graphical model which represents a set of variables and their
conditional dependencies using a directed acyclic graph. "Bayes' theorem in AI

data and experts opinions, and it consists of two parts:

Bayes' theorem in AI
Alarm ‘A’ – a node, say installed in a house of a person‘X’, which rings
upon two probabilities i.e burglary ‘B’ and Earthquake ‘E’, which are–
parent nodes of the alarm node.
The alarm is the parent node of two probabilities D calls ‘D’ & S calls
‘S’ person nodes.
Upon the instance of burglary and Earthquake, ‘D’ and ‘S’ call person
‘X’, respectively. 
But, there are few drawbacks in this case, as sometimes ‘D’ may forget
to call the person‘X’, even after hearing the alarm, as he has a tendency
to forget things, quick. 
Similarly, ‘S’, sometimes fails to call the person‘X’, as he is only able to
hear the alarm, from a certain distance.

A mechanic knows these facts:
If a car has engine trouble, it is likely to make a loud noise 80% of the time.
(This means P(A∣ B)=0.80, where A = loud noise and B = engine trouble).
The chance of a car having engine trouble is very small, only 0.000033.
(This means P(B)=0.000033).
The chance of any car making a loud noise is 2%.
(This means P(A)=0.02).
The question is:
If a car is making a loud noise, what is the chance it actually has engine trouble?

THE WORLD OF AI
... and the connections to Machine Learning and Deep Learning
A r t i f i c i a l

L e a r n i n gD e e p
L e a r n i n gMany people are confused what these terms actually mean.
AI refers to machines trained to perform
tasks requiring "intelligence."
Originated in the 1940s with the invention of
computers.
Key early contributors: Turing and John von
Neumann.
AI encompasses fields like machine
learning, NLP, computer vision, robotics,
and more.
Often confused with ML or basic data analysis
in modern usage.

MACHINE LEARNING
ML focuses on mathematically well-defined,
narrow tasks.
Constructs predictive/decision models from
data rather than explicit programming.
Learning is defined as improvement in task
performance (T) based on experience (E),
measured by performance (P).
Tom Mitchell's 1998 definition highlights this
concept.

ML VS. STATS
ML and Statistics originated in different fields but share equivalent mathematical
foundations.
ML models focus on precise predictions; statistical models emphasize pattern
interpretation and sound inference.
ML and predictive modeling in statistics address similar problems using similar tools.
Communities remain divided with inconsistent terminology causing confusion.
ML can often be viewed as nonparametric statistics combined with efficient numerical
optimization.

--- Page 7 ---

UNSUPERVISED LEARNING
Unsupervised learning involves data without labels
(no "true" output to optimize against).
Focuses on finding patterns within input data (x).
Common methods in unsupervised learning:
Dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA, Auto
encoders) > Compress information.
Clustering: Group similar observations.
Outlier and anomaly detection.
Association rules.

REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a general-purpose
AI framework.
Interaction with the environment involves:
Observing the state.
Receiving a reward.
Executing an action.
Goal: Maximize future rewards.
Challenges: Reward signals can be sparse, noisy,
and delayed.

DATA IN SUPERVISED LEARNING
The data we deal with in supervised learning usually consists of observations on different aspects of objects:
Target: the output variable / goal of prediction
Features: measurable properties that provide a concise description of the object
We assume some kind of relationship between the features and the target, in a sense that the value of the
target variable can be explained by a combination of the features.

Intelligence Workshop</i>, in <i>Proceedings of Machine Learning Research</i> 207:1-6 Available from https://proceedings.mlr.press/v207/bothmann23a.html.

--- Page 17 ---

ATTRIBUTE TYPES
Feature and Target Variable Types:
Numerical variables: Real-valued data (R).
Integer variables: Discrete whole numbers (Z).
Categorical variables: Defined categories (e.g., colors, types).
Binary variables: Two possible values (e.g., 0 or 1, True/False).
Tasks Based on Target Variable:
Regression: For continuous numerical targets.
Classification: For categorical or binary targets.
Handling Features:
Most learning algorithms work with numerical features.
Some algorithms, like decision trees, can handle integers and categorical features directly.
For other cases, features must be encoded into numerical formats (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).
Assumption: Unless specified, features are considered numerical.
Bothmann, L., Strickroth, S., Casalicchio, G., Rügamer, D., Lindauer, M., Scheipl, F. &amp; Bischl, B.. (2023). Developing Open Source Educational Resources for Machine Learning and Data Science. <i>Proceedings of the Third Teaching Machine Learning and Artificial

ENCODING FOR CATEGORICAL FEATURES
One-Hot EncodingEncoding Methods:
Dummy Encoding
The machine learning algorithm can handle redundancy in input
data (e.g., decision trees, random forests, neural networks).
You want to maintain all category distinctions without losing
any information.
You don't have constraints on the input matrix being non-
singular.
Example: For neural networks or clustering tasks where
categorical information needs complete representation.The machine learning algorithm requires non-singular input
matrices (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression).
You need to reduce redundancy in encoded features to improve
computational efficiency and avoid multicollinearity.
Example: In linear regression, removing one column prevents
singularity in the design matrix.

--- Page 20 ---

DATA-GENERATING PROCESS IN ML
Assumption: Data from a Distribution:
The observed data (D) is assumed to be generated by an underlying process characterized
by a probability distribution: 
                                                                                             P(x,y)
This distribution defines the joint behavior of input features (x) and target variables (y).
Random Variables:
x: Random variable representing input features, sampled from the input space X.
y: Random variable representing target values, sampled from the output space Y.

Intelligence Workshop</i>, in <i>Proceedings of Machine Learning Research</i> 207:1-6 Available from https://proceedings.mlr.press/v207/bothmann23a.html.

--- Page 21 ---

DATA-GENERATING PROCESS IN ML
True Distribution is Unknown:
The actual distribution P(x,y) is not directly observable or known.
It represents the real-world process that generates the data.
Goal of Machine Learning:
Learning involves uncovering or approximating the structure of P(x,y), or parts of it, to
make predictions or understand relationships.
This approximation is done using:
A model f(x) for predictions.
Algorithms to estimate parameters or identify patterns in P(x,y).

Intelligence Workshop</i>, in <i>Proceedings of Machine Learning Research</i> 207:1-6 Available from https://proceedings.mlr.press/v207/bothmann23a.html.

--- Page 22 ---

DATA-GENERATING PROCESS IN ML
Why This Matters:
The assumption of a data-generating process underpins statistical and machine learning
methods.
Models trained on observed data aim to generalize to unseen data, relying on the
assumption that the data was sampled from P(x,y)
Key Challenges:
The true distribution P(x,y) is often complex, high-dimensional, and only partially
represented in finite datasets.
Learning methods must handle this uncertainty and approximate P(x,y) effectively for the
task at hand.

Intelligence Workshop</i>, in <i>Proceedings of Machine Learning Research</i> 207:1-6 Available from https://proceedings.mlr.press/v207/bothmann23a.html.

--- Page 23 ---

DATA-GENERATING PROCESS IN ML
Assumption: Data is assumed to be independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.).
All samples come from the same probability
distribution.
Each sample is independent of others.
Why This Matters:
This assumption simplifies theoretical foundations in
machine learning.
It ensures the model learns from a consistent and
unbiased data source.
Limitation:
The i.i.d. assumption may not hold in real-world
scenarios (e.g., time series or dependent data).

extraction, which becomes impractical with large, high-
dimensional data like images or videos.
Unstructured Data Limitation: ML models are not inherently
designed for unstructured formats (e.g., audio, text, images).
Complex Relationships: Fails to capture hierarchical or
layered patterns effectively.

https://proceedings.mlr.press/v207/bothmann23a.html.Deep learning can be extremely valuable if the data has these properties:
It is high dimensional. 
Each single feature itself is not very informative but only a combination of them might be.
There is a large amount of training data.
This implies that for tabular data, deep learning is rarely the correct model choice.
Without extensive tuning, models like random forests or gradient boosting will outperform deep
learning most of the time.
One exception is data with categorical features with many levels.

Image segmentation is a process that divides an image
into multiple segments or regions, making it easier to
analyze and understand.
Partitions the image into meaningful sections, like
objects, backgrounds, or specific regions of interest.
Helps identify boundaries and shapes of objects
within the image.
Types of Segmentation:
Semantic Segmentation: Labels each pixel in the
image with a class (e.g., sky, road, car).a.
Instance Segmentation: Separates individual objects
of the same class (e.g., two cars are segmented
separately).b.

In the domain of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the term "perceptron" is frequently used. The
fundamental building block of artificial neural networks, the perceptron is the most fundamental part of machine
learning and deep learning technologies.
A single-layer neural network linear or machine learning
approach called a perceptron is used to learn different
binary classifiers under supervision. 
Perceptron is a linear classifier (binary) and is a
collection of straightforward logical assertions that
combine to form a neural network, which is an array
of sophisticated logical assertions. It is employed in
supervised learning as well. Classifying the provided
input data is helpful. https://www.lucentinnovation.com/blogs/technology-posts/understanding-the-perceptron

other perceptrons.
Connections (Synapses):
Biological Neurons: Synapses connect dendrites to neurons and
determine signal strength.
Perceptrons: Weights represent the importance of each input, similar to
synapse strength.
Processing (Nucleus):
Biological Neurons: The nucleus processes input signals to generate an
output.
Perceptrons: A mathematical function (nucleus) processes inputs to
produce an output value.
Output (Axon):
Biological Neurons: Axons carry the output signal to other neurons.
Perceptrons: The output value serves as input for the next perceptron.https://www.lucentinnovation.com/blogs/technology-posts/understanding-the-perceptron

https://proceedings.mlr.press/v207/bothmann23a.html.How Does the Perceptron Work?
The perceptron is a simple model for solving binary classification problems (e.g., output 0 or 1).
Key Components: 1.
Inputs (x1,x2,x3 ): Data features passed into the model.
Weights (w1,w2,w3 ): Represent the importance of each input.
Threshold: A value used to decide if the output is 0 or 1 based on the weighted sum of inputs.
Working Mechanism: 2.
Compute the weighted sum:     z= w1x1+w2x2+w3x3+bias
Apply the threshold:
If   z>threshold, output = 1.
If   z≤threshold, output = 0.
Learning Process: 3.
Adjust Weights:
The perceptron modifies the weights during training to minimize the error between the expected and actual outputs.
Iterative Updates:
This process is repeated until the weights converge to a stable solution.
Binary Classifier: 4.
The perceptron classifies data into two categories (e.g., 0 or 1).https://www.lucentinnovation.com/blogs/technology-posts/understanding-the-perceptron

Weights (w1,w2,...,wn ):
Assigned to each input to determine its importance.
Initially random and updated during training.
Summation Function:
Computes the weighted sum:   z=w1 x1 +w2 x2 +...+wn xn 
Represents the dot product of the input vector and the weight vector.

Bias (b):
A constant added to the weighted sum to adjust the output.
Allows learning even when inputs are zero.

Single layer Perceptron
The single-layer Perceptron is made up of a single layer of
neurons that adds up all of the inputs and uses an activation
function to determine the output.

SUPERVISED LEARNING
Supervised tasks are data situations where learning the functional relationship between inputs (features)
and output (target) is useful.
The two most basic tasks are regression and classiﬁcation, depending on whether the target is numerical
or categorical.

SUPERVISED LEARNING
We can distinguish two main reasons to learn this relationship:
Learning to Predict
Focus: The outcome, not the structure or interpretability of the model.
Goal: Make accurate predictions for new data.
Example: Forecasting stock prices for practical decision-making.
Value: Directly benefits by providing actionable predictions.
Learning to Explain
Focus: Gaining insights into the relationships within the data.
Goal: Understand factors and their influence on outcomes.
Example: Identifying risk factors for diseases.
Value: Used to inform scientific, medical, or social discussions rather than operational predictions.

Think of a hypothesis space as a menu of all possible models that we can choose from for a specific problem.
Each model on the menu has a specific way of making predictions.
Without narrowing down the options, finding the "best model" would be impossible because the choices would be
unlimited.
Key Idea: To make this manageable, we restrict the menu to a specific type of models (like linear models, neural networks,
etc.), which is called a structural prior
Imagine each model in the hypothesis space as a recipe, and the ingredients (parameters) in the recipe determine the
specific dish (model).
Parametrization means using these ingredients (parameters) to adjust and fine-tune the recipe to make the model work
for the given data.
All the models in the hypothesis space share the same basic structure (e.g., all are linear equations or neural networks).
The specific differences between the models come from the parameters we use to define them.PARAMETRIZATION

better.
In a straight-line model (like predicting trends), the slope and intercept are
parameters that decide how steep or flat the line is.
When we "set" these parameters, the model becomes fully defined and ready
to make predictions.
Instead of thinking of a hypothesis space as just a menu of models, think of it as a
collection of all possible ways you can tweak the knobs (parameters) to get the
best model for your data.
The whole point of parametrization is to help us find the best possible model
for our data within the hypothesis space by tuning the parameters.
This process is what makes machine learning models adaptable to different
problems!HYPOTHESIS SPACES

When training a learner, we optimize over our hypothesis space, to ﬁnd the function which matches our training data best.
This means, we are looking for a function, where the predicted output per training point is as close as possible to the
observed label.
To make this precise, we need to dene now how we measure the difference between a
prediction and a ground truth label pointwise.

https://proceedings.mlr.press/v207/bothmann23a.html.TYPES OF LOSS
A loss function measures how far off a model’s prediction is from
the true value for a single observation. 
Absolute Loss:
Treats all errors equally, regardless of size.
Mapping:
The loss function takes:
True value (y)
Predicted value f(x)
and computes a numerical value indicating error.
In simple terms, the loss function tells us how "wrong" the
model's predictions are for each observation.

--- Page 18 ---

Optimization is the process of finding the best model parameters that minimize a given loss function 
(i.e., reduce prediction errors).
It ensures the model learns patterns in the data effectively.
Gradient Descent

https://proceedings.mlr.press/v207/bothmann23a.html.https://arunp77.medium.com/regression-algorithms-29f112797724Linear Regression
Definition: Predicts a continuous outcome by finding the straight-line
relationship between input variables (features) and the output.
Where to Use: When the relationship between input and output is roughly
linear.
Example: Predicting house prices based on size, location, and number of
rooms.
Polynomial Regression
Definition: Fits a curve to the data, rather than a straight line, to capture
non-linear relationships.
Where to Use: When the data shows a curved or complex trend instead of
a straight-line relationship.
Example: Predicting the growth of plants over time when the growth rate
slows down after an initial burst.
Logistic Regression
Definition: Used to predict probabilities and classify data into categories
(e.g., yes/no, true/false).
Where to Use: For binary or multi-class classification problems.
Example: Predicting whether an email is spam (yes or no).

Definition: Adds a penalty to prevent the model from being too sensitive to
small changes in the data.
Where to Use: When the data has many correlated variables, and you want
to avoid overfitting.
Example: Predicting demand for products with many related factors like
price, weather, and season.
Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)
Definition: Similar to Ridge Regression but also shrinks some variables to
zero, effectively selecting only the most important features.
Where to Use: For feature selection in high-dimensional data.
Example: Identifying the most important factors in predicting a patient’s risk
of heart disease from a large set of health indicators.
Support Vector Regression (SVR)
Definition: Finds the best-fit line or curve within a certain margin of
tolerance to capture the data’s trends.
Where to Use: For complex, non-linear relationships with high-dimensional
data.
Example: Predicting stock prices based on a variety of technical indicators.

A decision boundary is a line (or surface in higher dimensions) that separates different classes in the feature space.
It helps the model decide which class a data point belongs to based on its features.
In machine learning, decision boundaries can be straight lines (linear models) or curved/complex shapes (non-linear models) depending
on the algorithm used!

Decision Boundary: Curved lines, showing how Naive Bayes considers
probabilistic assumptions about the data.
Behavior: Handles more complex relationships compared to logistic regression
but may not perfectly separate classes.
Decision Tree (rpart)
Decision Boundary: Step-like, creating rectangular regions based on feature
splits.
Behavior: Divides the space using simple rules, useful for interpretable models,
but can miss smooth transitions between classes.
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Boundary: Smooth, non-linear curves, showing SVM's ability to handle
more complex patterns.
Behavior: Creates flexible boundaries using kernels, great for datasets with
intricate class separations

https://proceedings.mlr.press/v207/bothmann23a.html.XOR Problem Basics:
XOR (Exclusive OR) outputs 1 when inputs are different (e.g., 0,1 or 1,0) and 0
when inputs are the same (e.g., 0,0 or 1,1).
XOR is not linearly separable, meaning a straight line cannot separate the output
classes.
Why Logistic Regression Fails:
Logistic regression works by finding a straight line (or hyperplane) to separate
data.
Since XOR data is not linearly separable, logistic regression cannot classify it
correctly.

Model Equation:
Input Layer:
The input, x, is a 2D vector representing the XOR input values (x1,x2 ).
Weights (W):
A weight matrix (W) is applied to the inputs to transform them into a new space.
This transformation helps make the data linearly separable.
Bias (b):
A bias vector is added to the weighted input to shift the transformation, improving flexibility.
ReLU Activation ( σ ):
The ReLU function. σ(z)=max(0,z) is applied to the result, introducing non-linearity.
Non-linearity is crucial for solving non-linear problems like XOR.
Output Layer:
The transformed values are further processed using:  A weight vector (u) and bias (c).
The final result is passed through a thresholding function (τ) that outputs 0 or 1.

Simple functions/models (e.g., logistic regression) can be visually represented as
graphs.
This helps break down complex concepts into understandable pieces.
Building Blocks for Complex Functions:
Individual neurons act as basic units or "building blocks."
Combining neurons creates networks capable of handling complex tasks.
Representation of Complex Hypotheses:
Neural networks can model highly intricate patterns and relationships in data.
They provide access to vast "hypothesis spaces" for learning.
Learning Common Patterns Efficiently:
Neural networks enable us to focus on hypothesis spaces aligned with real-world
data.
This data-efficient learning approach mirrors common patterns found in nature
and our universe.

Before deep learning, domain experts manually designed features for tasks like
image recognition and speech processing.
This process is called feature engineering and is crucial for model performance.
Instead of manually designing features, deep learning models learn features
automatically from raw data.
This automation is a core strength of deep learning.Deep Learning Automates This Process:

https://proceedings.mlr.press/v207/bothmann23a.html.Why is this Important?
Feeding a classifier the "right" features is critical for success.
Deep learning eliminates the dependency on manual expertise, enabling models to find
the most effective representation on their own.
Examples:
In image recognition, instead of manually extracting edges or textures, deep learning
discovers these patterns in layers.
In speech recognition, it learns phonemes and patterns directly from audio data without
requiring hand-crafted features.
Key Insight:
Deep learning replaces traditional feature engineering with automated representation
learning, improving efficiency and adaptability.

Revising: Squared Error:
Measures the difference between predicted and true values by squaring the error.
Works well for regression or simple problems but not ideal for classification.
Introducing: Cross-Entropy Loss:
Used in multi-class classification.
Measures how far the predicted probability is from the correct class.
Example: If the true class is 3, it compares the predicted probability for class 3 to 1 (perfect match).
Why Cross-Entropy?
It penalizes wrong predictions more effectively by focusing on the probabilities assigned to the correct class.

Neural networks today can have hundreds of hidden layers. 
The greater the number of layers, the "deeper" the network. 
Historically DNNs were very challenging to train and not popular until the late ’00s for several reasons:
The use of sigmoid activations (e.g., logistic sigmoid and tanh) signicantly slowed down training due
to a phenomenon known as “vanishing gradients”. The introduction of the ReLU activation largely
solved this problem.
Training DNNs on CPUs was too slow to be practical. Switching over to GPUs cut down training
time by more than an order of magnitude.
When dataset sizes are small, other models (such as SVMs) and techniques (such as feature
engineering) often outperform them.

The availability of large datasets and novel architectures that are capable of handling even complex tensor-
shaped data (e.g. CNNs for image data), faster hardware, and better optimization and regularization methods
made it feasible to successfully implement deep neural networks.
An increase in depth often translates to an increase in performance on a given task. State-of-the-art neural
networks, however, are much more sophisticated than the simple architectures we have encountered so far.
The term "deep learning" encompasses all of these developments and refers to the eld as a whole.

What Are CNNs?
CNNs are a type of neural network designed to process
visual data (like images).
They are inspired by how the human brain processes
visual information, particularly the visual cortex.
How Do CNNs Work?
CNNs detect patterns in images, starting with simple
features (like edges or corners) and building up to more
complex features (like faces or objects).
This happens in a hierarchical way, similar to how the
brain processes vision.
Brain Analogy :
Visual Cortex Layers:
The brain processes visual inputs in stages:
Simple features: Edges and corners (early stages).
Intermediate features: Shapes or outlines.
Complex objects: Faces or objects (later stages).
CNN Mimics This Process:
Early layers of CNNs detect edges and textures (like the brain detecting edges).
Middle layers find shapes or parts of objects.
Final layers identify the whole object, like a face.

https://proceedings.mlr.press/v207/bothmann23a.html.Key Features of CNNs
CNNs are made up of building blocks and components that automatically extract important features from data.
They excel in extracting spatial patterns (like shapes, textures, and positions) from input data.
Though originally designed for images, CNNs are also used in other domains like:
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Audio Processing
Time-Series Analysis
Image Classification:
Identifying the category or label of an image (e.g., cat, dog, car).
Object Detection/Localization:
Finding and identifying objects in an image (e.g., detecting a car and its position in the image).
Semantic Segmentation:
Dividing an image into regions and labeling each region (e.g., labeling every pixel as "sky," "tree," or "road").Applications of CNNs in Computer Vision

FILTERS TO EXTRACT FEATURES
Filters are widely applied in Computer Vision (CV) since the 70’s.
 
One prominent example: Sobel-Filter. It detects edges in images.
F i g u r e :Sobel-ﬁltered image.What Are Edges?
Edges happen where pixel intensity changes quickly (e.g., between
light and dark areas).
How to Detect Edges?
Approximate the gradient (rate of intensity change) for each pixel.
Sobel Gradient in the X-Direction:
Sobel filter approximates the gradient Gx  in the x-dimension using this
formula:Gx =Sx ∗ A
A: Original image.
Sx : Sobel filter matrix.
∗: Convolution (a special operation, not standard multiplication).
Applying the Sobel filter detects edges by calculating intensity changes
across the image in specific directions (x or y).

How to represent a digital image?
Basically as an array of integers.
Digital image is just numbers organized in an array that computers can process, with each number representing how bright or
colorful a pixel is.
For simplicity, the image is converted to black and white (grayscale):
Black = 0 (low intensity).
White = 255 (high intensity).
Every pixel is assigned a value between 0 and 255, representing brightness.Width

S_x: enables us to to detect vertical edges!
 The Sobel Operator Sx  is used as a filter to
detect vertical edges in the image.
The filter slides (convolves) across the
image matrix.
At each position, it performs:
Element-wise multiplication between
the filter and the image region.
Summation of the results.
The output matrix highlights vertical edges
by assigning high values where edges occur.
A small section of the image matrix is
shown being processed with Sx , resulting in
a new value in the feature map.

A new matrix (feature map) is produced where:
High values correspond to detected edges.
Low values indicate areas with no edges.
Normalization: The feature map is scaled or normalized
to better highlight the patterns.

https://proceedings.mlr.press/v207/bothmann23a.html.how a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) works
Input Layer 
Data is fed into the network one step at a time (e.g., words in a sentence
or time-series values).
Each input at a time step is processed sequentially.
Hidden Layers 
These layers process the input and maintain a "memory" by passing
information from one time step to the next through loops (recurrent
connections).
The hidden state captures both the current input and the context from
previous time steps.
Output Layer 
The network produces an output at each time step (e.g., predicting the
next word or value).
The final output (blue) represents the network's prediction after
processing all time steps.
Recurrent Connections:
The feedback loops in the hidden layers allow the RNN to "remember"
past data, which makes it suitable for sequential data processing.

https://proceedings.mlr.press/v207/bothmann23a.html.vanishing gradient problem
The vanishing gradient problem happens when gradients (used to update neural network weights) become very
small during backpropagation. This makes it hard for the network to learn because the weights in earlier layers are
barely updated. It’s common in deep networks like RNNs when processing long sequences, as information from
earlier steps "fades away" over time.

Why LSTMs?
Overcome RNN's vanishing gradient problem.
Designed for learning long-term dependencies.
Key Components:
Forget Gate: Decides what to discard from the memory.
Input Gate: Updates the cell state with new information.
Output Gate: Controls the final output based on
memory.
Applications:
Language modeling, video analysis, and predictive
analytics.

https://proceedings.mlr.press/v207/bothmann23a.html.Overfitting
Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and
irrelevant details, which hurts its ability to generalize to new data.
Signs of Overfitting:
High accuracy on training data but poor accuracy on validation/testing data.
Example:
A neural network memorizes specific training examples instead of learning general patterns.
Solution Approaches:
Use more training data.
Apply regularization (e.g., L2 or dropout).
Simplify the model by reducing its complexity.

Overtraining is when a model is trained for too many epochs, leading to overfitting and
decreased performance on unseen data.
How to Recognize Overtraining:
Validation accuracy starts to drop after a certain number of epochs.
Prevention:
Use validation data to monitor performance.
Apply early stopping.
