# Pathfinding Game - Solution
## حل لعبة البحث عن المسار

## 🚀 How to Run | كيفية التشغيل

### Quick Start
```bash
cd "Course 02/PROJECTS/01_Pathfinding_Game/SOLUTION"
python pathfinding_solution.py
```

### What You'll See

1. **Console Output:**
   - Algorithm comparison
   - Path lengths for BFS, DFS, and A*
   - Summary statistics

2. **Three Matplotlib Windows:**
   - **BFS Visualization:** Shows shortest path found by BFS
   - **DFS Visualization:** Shows path found by DFS (may be longer)
   - **A* Visualization:** Shows optimal path found by A*

### Visual Elements

- **Green Circle:** Start position
- **Red Circle:** Goal position
- **Black:** Walls/obstacles
- **White:** Empty paths
- **Blue Line:** Found path

### Demo Tips for Teachers

1. **Run multiple times** to show different mazes
2. **Point out differences:**
   - BFS finds shortest path
   - DFS may find longer paths
   - A* finds optimal path efficiently
3. **Close each plot window** before next appears
4. **Explain the algorithms** as they run

### Requirements

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
