## Code Practice | ممارسة الكود

### Can you write code to:
- [ ] Create a NumPy array and calculate its mean?
- [ ] Create a simple line plot with labels?
- [ ] Create a graph with NetworkX and add edges?
- [ ] Use deque to implement a queue?
- [ ] Use heapq to create a priority queue?

**If you answered "No" to any:** Practice those specific examples from the notebook

## Understanding Check | فحص الفهم

### Answer these questions (to yourself):

1. **When would I use NumPy instead of Python lists?**
   - [ ] I can explain this clearly
   - [ ] I'm not sure

2. **What's the difference between BFS and DFS data structures?**
   - [ ] I know (deque for BFS, stack for DFS)
   - [ ] I'm not sure

3. **When would I use a knowledge graph?**
   - [ ] I can give examples
   - [ ] I'm not sure

**If you're not sure about any:** Review those concepts before moving to Notebook 01
