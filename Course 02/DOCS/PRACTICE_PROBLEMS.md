- Path from A to E? (Should find: A → B → E or A → D → E)
- Path from C to D? (Should find: C → B → A → D)

**Hint:** Use `collections.deque` for queue

---

#### Problem 2.2: DFS Implementation (Beginner)
**Task:** Implement DFS to find a path between two nodes.

**Use the same graph as Problem 2.1**

**Compare:** Does DFS always find the shortest path? Why or why not?

---

**Task:** Implement A* algorithm with:
- Manhattan distance heuristic
- Euclidean distance heuristic

**Compare:** Which heuristic finds the path faster? Why?

**Test on a 10x10 grid with obstacles.**

### Topic 3: Knowledge Representation

#### Problem 3.1: Knowledge Graph Creation (Beginner)
**Task:** Create a knowledge graph representing:
- 5 people (nodes)
- Relationships: "knows", "works_with", "lives_in"
- At least 10 relationships total

**Visualize the graph using NetworkX.**

---

#### Problem 3.2: Rule-Based System (Intermediate)
**Task:** Create a simple rule-based system for weather advice:

**Rules:**
- IF temperature > 30 AND sunny THEN "Wear sunscreen"
- IF temperature < 10 THEN "Wear jacket"
- IF raining THEN "Bring umbrella"
- IF temperature > 25 AND not_raining THEN "Good weather for outdoor activities"

**Implement forward chaining to give advice based on current conditions.**

---

#### Problem 3.3: Semantic Network (Advanced)
**Task:** Create a semantic network for animals with inheritance:
- Animal (parent class)
  - Mammal (child of Animal)
    - Dog (child of Mammal)
    - Cat (child of Mammal)
  - Bird (child of Animal)
    - Eagle (child of Bird)

**Properties:**
- All animals: "breathes", "eats"
- Mammals: "has_fur", "warm_blooded"
- Birds: "has_feathers", "can_fly"

**Implement inheritance so child classes inherit parent properties.**

---

### Topic 4: Uncertainty & Probability

#### Problem 4.1: Basic Probability (Beginner)
**Task:** Simulate coin flips:
- Flip a coin 1000 times
- Calculate probability of heads
- Calculate probability of getting 3 heads in a row
- Visualize results with histogram

**Hint:** Use `np.random.choice()` or `np.random.randint()`

---

#### Problem 4.2: Bayesian Inference (Intermediate)
**Task:** Implement a simple medical diagnosis system:

**Given:**
- P(Disease) = 0.01 (1% of population has disease)
- P(Positive Test | Disease) = 0.95 (95% accurate if diseased)
- P(Positive Test | No Disease) = 0.05 (5% false positive)

**Calculate:** P(Disease | Positive Test)

**Interpret:** What does this tell you about medical testing?

---

#### Problem 4.3: Monte Carlo Simulation (Intermediate)
**Task:** Estimate π using Monte Carlo method:
- Generate random points in a 1x1 square
